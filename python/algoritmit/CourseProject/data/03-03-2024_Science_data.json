I felt great and did not feel hunger, tired, or grumpy.  I still worked out and worked fine.\n\nOne of the most notable effects I had while fasting was having very lucid dreams, they get wild.  They feel so real and very detailed compared to normal dreams.  I also got colder.  I assume from less overall water/blood.\n\nYou still get cravings but as far as hunger, maybe once or twice a day for a minute.  I still pooped but incredibly small amounts and maybe once every other 2-3 days.\n\nMy favorite thing is after fasting for even one day, I get a craving for healthy stuff.  I start watching youtube videos of healthy meals I want to make to break my fast.  I never took too much care about going back to eating.  I only craved a small amount and even hearty ingredients went well with me.  Another is I could do nothing all day and know I am losing weight.\n\nWorst thing about fasting is if people find out I'm not eating, they panic and try to force feed me.  Constant concerns and lots of misinformation get thrown at me like: \"You'll get ulcers\", \"Your body will eat your muscle before fat\", or \"One of my family members didn't eat for a day and passed away from a heart attack.\"\n\nAll this info was already in r/fasting but it is nice to have more evidence it works.  I believe the term for this process is autophagy.",

(I can't imagine you'd lose much muscle in only 3 days or less.) I don't know if fat mass is easily lost or built up in only 3 days normally either, depending on what you actually eat. If you don't eat fatty foods, the body would need to convert other things to fat and then store it, so only 3 days may be far too short a time to really judge. They probably didn't actually gain or lose any \"real\" weight in such short periods. My weight varies by 3 pounds within a single day. Just waiting for the gut to completely flush during fasting could probably drop your weight a few extra pounds. Then eating for 3 days just fills you back up.",

                "body": "Most weightloss from fasting in the first few days is Glycogen water and poop weight. Pounds of Fat loss per fasted day will be your TDEE/3500. In my case at my starting weight of 200lb my TDEE was 2400kcals/3500=0.68lb fat loss per fasted day and the scale proved this out. The scale was able to prove it out because I only ever weighed myself at the end of a 72hr fast when I knew I had shed all my Glycogen water and poop weight from the last refeed, so with that variable removed the scale just showed fat loss and it tallied with the simple formula.\n\nGlycogen is the bodies short term glucose storage and is 4 molecules of water for every molecule of glucose and is stored in the liver and muscles. The lean mass loss is mostly just the muscle glycogen water released and pissed out when the body uses up the muscle glycogen and which gets topped back up next time you refeed with carbs. However a small amount of the lean mass loss is indeed muscle converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis before the full transition into ketosis and full keytone production which the brain starts using instead of glucose. (The rest of the body already using triglycerides from the fat.) That small lean mass consumption gets replaced very quickly once eating exogenous protein again.\n\nNo one lost 5.3kg of fat and muscle on a 3 day fast. They likely lost at most 1-2kg of fat depending on their TDEE and the rest was glycogen water and poop and a few hundred grams of lean muscle that they regained as soon as they started eating again with only the fat staying gone.",

After the 3 or 4 days I lose around ~6\u20139lbs.\nRefeeding after the fast, your body becomes flushed with stem cells. The gut especially gets flushed with stem cells and is now a revitalized digestion machine. I am able to down ungodly amounts of food and purposely stuff myself and stick to a work out plan. A week after the fast I am able to gain all the weight back, a little more of it is muscle than fat compared to my prefast state. \n\nOnce \u201cketosis\u201d kicks in around day 2 and you\u2019re running on fat, you reach a zen like state.

(Can't remember where I saw the study and can't cite it so pinch of salt with these numbers but from what I remember it was a large sample size and seemed like good methodology).\n\nPersonally I've found that cutting out refined sugar and 16-8hrs intermittent fasting (basically just a late breakfast and not eating again after your evening meal) is enough to lose 1-2lb a week but that would obviously depend on your normal eating habits and starting weight.\n\nIt's worth a try anyway, see if it works for you.",

Only when getting a new cycle going do I experience those symptoms for the first day or two but thereafter as long as i keep the rolling cycle going they are gone and stay gone for the duration of the cycle. Only when i have to stop the cycle for some reason and eat several days in a row do I experience those symptoms again upon restarting the cycle again.\n\nThe reason is ghrelin hunger hormone suppression. The hangriness, growling stomach and jelly legs are psychosomatic effects of the Ghrelin surge reminding me to eat at my regular meal times. They disappear as if by magic after a ghrelin surge abates usually within 2 hours of the skipped meal time. They permanently disappear when the body quickly learns to stop secreting ghrelin at the old skipped meal time. The headaches are carb withdrawl. As quickly as ghrelin surges are deprogrammed, a few days in a row eating at a certain time will reprogram one for that time. \n\nIn other words, consecutive rolling fasts are a total different ballgame to distinct multiday fasts where you have to go through those symptoms every time you do another because you reprogrammed your Ghrelin surges in between.",

So there could be hella health benefits with minimal muscle mass loss for doing a once in a while 3 day fast, like once every month or two.\n\nAlso FYI weight loss from cardio is more or less a myth. Cardio doesn't cause weight loss. If you focus on cardio trying to lose weight you'll just really frustrate yourself. Even a 5k is only going to burn like 100 calories. It sounds like you basically did a starvation diet and your body had to cannibalize muscles to keep you going.\n\nOne of the best ways to lose weight is to do things that keep insulin down by eating foods with a low glycemic index so that blood sugar stays low and keeps your body's insulin sensitivity high.\n\nThe gist here is that eating high GI foods that spike your blood sugar triggers your body to release lots of insulin. Insulin in turn signals your body to scoop up the glucose from the high GI foods and store it in liver, muscle, and fat cells. Even worse if you're chronically doing that, your body starts to lose sensitivity to insulin creating a negative feedback loop where your body has to release more insulin each time.\n\nBasically if you can minimize the insulin response process, you can minimize fat gain because sugars aren't being stored in fat cells and your body stays sensitive to insulin which further reduces how much excess glucose gets stored in fat.\n\nCardio is good for your body, it's just not great for weight loss. However it does have indirect benefits for weight loss. By working your muscles, you force them to burn stored glucose. Then when you do eat something that increases insulin and signals your body to store the ingested carbs/sugars, your body will shuffle part of it to muscles to restore the burned off energy supply. Then that means less of it is going to fat cells.\n\nHowever aerobic exercise makes your muscles use oxygen for energy and not as much glucose, so for weight loss a good strategy is to do anaerobic workouts so that your muscles are more efficiently using their glucose stores instead of oxygen for energy.\n\nSo in a nutshell combining anaerobic workouts with a low sugar diet (or even keto) that's high in protein and fats will probably cause weight loss with minimal muscle loss and probably even muscle gains. And the best part of it is, you don't have to starve yourself! Fats and proteins don't really cause weight gain, it's mostly the sugars and carbs doing that.",

                "body": "I didn\u2019t read the article. Im answering the guys question about the lean mass loss and regain. I assumed the 2-3 days of fasting referenced in the headline was the total consecutive fasted days they did. Turns out its 7 days fasts like you said. With my TDEE of 2400 and dividing by 7,700kcals (calories in 1kg of fat) = 0.31kg fat loss per fasted day x 7 days = 2.18kg fat loss. The remainder of the 5.7kg \u2018weightloss\u2019 from the test subjects being glycogen water and poop weight.\n\nThe person I replied to seems to be under the impression that a significant percentage of the 5.7kg \u2018weightloss\u2019 is true lean muscle tissue mass which is what the article seems to imply too and hence its no wonder they are wondering how one could add several kilograms of lean muscle tissue mass back in only a few days of post fast eating when it takes much longer to add that much muscle mass via weight training and surplus calorie and protein eating. My point is that the \u2018lean muscle mass\u2019 loss is mostly just muscle glycogen water loss with only a few hundred grams of actual muscle tissue loss due to gluconeogenesis. You regain so much \u2018lean muscle mass\u2019 back so quickly because its mostly muscle glycogen water you actually lost and those glycogen stores in the liver and muscles are rebuilt very quickly once you consume a few days of carbs and your body retains all the heavy water needed to rebuild the glycogen. It also doesn\u2019t take long to rebuild the actual few hundred grams of actual muscle tissue consumed by gluconeogenesis\n\nNowhere did I say they didn\u2019t lose 5.7kg of \u2018weight\u2019. I am simply pointing out that only about 2\u2019ish kg of it was true fat loss that wont naturally come back on after a few days eating post fast. We deal with this a lot on the fasting subreddit where folks see and get excited by huge drops on the scale during the first few days of a multiday fast but then massive disappointment when they see the scale show they regained most of the lost \u2018weight\u2019 back after they ended the fast. We explain to them that most of the weight loss and regain on the scale is glycogen water and poop weight loss and regain, that its a natural part of the fasting process and that they shouldn\u2019t get excited by the weightloss shown on the scale during the fast but equally there is no need for disappointment when they put it back on after the fast is ended. The fat they lost on the fast is their TDEE / 3500imp or 7700metric per fasted day and it stays gone as long as they eat at or below maintenance after the fast.\n\nYou also get folks doing 7 day fasts like this study or even longer and wondering why they seemed to be losing several kilograms a day for the first 2-4 days but then their rate of loss massively slowed down and they are wondering why. The answer is the same as above. ie. For the first few days they are losing fat AND glycogen water and poop weight which the scale shows but after that when their gut is completely empty and all their liver and muscle glycogen stores depleted and the water pissed out, now the scale will start to show only their true fat loss.",

If IF was superior in fat reduction and total body composition outcomes it would be the norm for body builders. But the norm is still eating 4-6meals a day, including during a cut, and still eating carbs, and they are still able to get to single digit bodyfat while holding onto a ton of muscle. I'm not against IF as a way to simply lose weight because I find it easy to get into a pattern of not eating all day and eating basically once at night because then I can be pretty loose with my calories because even McDonald's is only like 1000-1200kcal tops, but as far as muscle retention or gain goes, it's far from ideal.

That actually seems pretty good to me. Many people don't need to be in a 3000 calorie/week deficit.\n\nIf you run the equivalent of four 5Ks/week, that's over 17 lbs of fat burned over a year (52 weeks * 4 runs * 300 Cal/run / 3500 = 17.8 lbs), assuming you don't eat extra after exercise (we're making a similar assumption about fasting).

Those two statements don't mean much, except that we've also got very clear linkage between both geography and urbanization to musical tastes. \n\nSo:\n\n* Urbanization level predicts musical preference\n* Geographic location predicts musical preference\n* Urbanization level predicts political alignment\n* Geographic location predicts political alignment\n* Bonus: At some levels of granularity: Geographic location predicts (broad) urbanization level\n\n(We can probably find more linkages here --such as diversity indexes or education levels-- but I grabbed the easy ones)\n\nStringing those together to say that Musical preference predicts political alignment is just following the transitivity of bias. It follows exactly the pattern we'd expect based on existing sampling patterns. So, one of two things is happening in this study:\n\n* (Yet again) A study was conducted looking at behavior and preferences without looking at the large bias that location and pre-existing patterns have on the thing being measured\n* The study was meant to confirm the null hypothesis\n\nIn the first case, its annoying that the bias wasn't more strongly accounted for. The paper acknowledges the fact that music has a connection to urbanization and location, but it's not controlled any further.\n\nSo, even if we give them the benefit of the doubt, this just confirms the null hypothesis, but in a way that has low usefulness. Cool, those patterns and biases that we expected still exist. The authors try to point out that the most simplistic assumptions weren't displayed (that \"urban\" music styles weren't the most strongly associated with Democrats), but then go on to admit that their sample was small and heavily over-samples older white females. And without trying to sound overly prejudicial, I strongly suspect that the older white females are not the prime target of rap and hip hop. \n\nIt's just not a ton of useful information, and the reasonably supported info has already been covered by other demographics and studies.",

                "body": "> The rapid effects of a single dose of ketamine result from increased activity of immature neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus without an increase in neurogenesis. Treatment with six doses of ketamine over two weeks doubled the duration of behavioral effects after the final ketamine injection. However, unlike ketamine\u2019s rapid effects, this more sustained behavioral effect did not correlate with increased immature neuron activity but instead correlated with increased numbers of calretinin-positive and doublecortin-positive immature neurons. This increase in neurogenesis was associated with a decrease in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, a known inhibitor of neurogenesis.\n\nTl;dr - multiple ketamine treatments spurred neurogenesis in the hippocampus, rather than just the excitation of immature neurons (which is what you see with a single dose). Makes sense, as a lack of neurogensis is a hallmark of depression.",

However this method is very expensive and would probably cost many thousands per lens even when scaled up. Meta-lenses also still have issues with poor efficiency, scattered light and chromatic aberration.\n\nOne thing I have often heard repeated is that meta-lenses will make all optics flat.  According to [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-022-01038-6), that is not true.
