    - Damn, so white conservatives think peaceful protests are the same as riots when it's the African-Americans doing it.
    - The amount of neo-terms within this article is wild. Inventing language to get to the finish line.
    - Seeing that guy bleeding to death from a gunshot to the gut while trying to protect his small business from looting while crying for help and the protesters are just walking over his body and pool of blood ignoring him while he cried for help and died was what led me to lose support.
