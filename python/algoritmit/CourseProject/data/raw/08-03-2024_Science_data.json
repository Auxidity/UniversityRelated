So, a child with lazy eye is probably less likely to participate in sports by virtue of having a strong disadvantage. Less sports, less activity, more obesity.\n\nMy lazy eye was treated, but not well enough to give me binocular vision. I strongly favor my left eye. I can try to force myself to use both eyes, but it results in a confusing seeing-double parallax effect. I only use my right eye for peripheral vision. I am and always was terrible at playing catch. I could only play defender in soccer. Lineman in football. Baseball and basketball were out of the question. I am good at shooting sports since using monocular vision to sight comes naturally, but being cross-eye dominate (not exclusive to monocular vision) complicates that.",

They were also asked if they had a medical diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure, or cardio/cerebrovascular disease (ie. angina, heart attack, stroke).  \nMeanwhile, their BMI (body mass index), blood glucose, and cholesterol levels were also measured and mortality was tracked.  \nThe researchers confirmed that from 3,238 participants who reported having a \u2018lazy eye\u2019 as a child, 82.2% had persistent reduced vision in one eye as an adult.  \nThe findings showed that participants with amblyopia as a child had 29% higher odds of developing diabetes, 25% higher odds of having hypertension and 16% higher odds of having obesity. They were also at increased risk of heart attack \u2013 even when other risk factors for these conditions (e.g. other disease, ethnicity and social class) were taken into account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589537024000725",

Utilizing a sourced dataset, statistical methods are used to explore the increasing rates of mental health disorders, with a focus on healthcare workers, gender disparities, and geographical variations. The study reveals a significant increase in the prevalence of mental health disorders over the past three decades. Healthcare workers were found to be at a particularly higher risk for adverse mental health outcomes. Additionally, the data showed notable geographical variations, indicating the need for region-specific healthcare policies. Gender disparities were also evident, emphasizing the importance of gender-specific mental health interventions. Policymakers and healthcare providers should consider these findings to implement effective mental health programs, especially for at-risk groups like healthcare workers. The study also highlights the need for future research to provide a more comprehensive understanding of mental health trends globally.",
