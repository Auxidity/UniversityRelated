Such improved detectors would not only help detect, localize and characterize undeclared special nuclear material being used contrary to federal or international regulations, but also help scientists explore the fundamental physics of particles and their interactions deep in the nucleus of the atom.",

                "body": ">To test their findings clinically, Albayram and his team examined postmortem human brains with and without long-term brain disease from concussions. Albayram was surprised to find that protein p17 levels were notably lower in the brains with disease. This outcome confirms what the team discovered in preclinical models \u2013 that protein p17 plays a small but mighty role in how the brain protects itself from disease.\n>\n>Protein p17 could be a target for future treatments that protect the brain after concussions and prevent long-term health consequences.\n>\n>Because researchers were able to trigger this recovery process in a preclinical model, a future goal is to develop similar drug treatments for humans. Yet, beyond just traumatic brain injury, these findings could inform how we treat brain disease broadly.\n\nPaper: [p17/C18-ceramide-mediated mitophagy is an endogenous neuroprotective response in preclinical and clinical brain injury - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38328780/)",

That seems more doubtful). Furthermore, it selects people who had already changed their opinions; it did not do anything like compare two groups, one passively receiving information and the other receiving something inert to the topic, and then measuring group changes. This seems like really bad study design, on the whole; selecting on the dependent variable isn\u2019t a great idea in general, and here, we have no idea how common changing opinions actually is as a result of it. We just know that some people in a sample of 18 said they did it, and claim that the reasons they\u2019re talking about were the reasons. Also, as the authors note, they didn\u2019t define view change; they let respondents define that for themselves. This is a really bad study, quite frankly, even if the authors weren\u2019t using a convenience sample (which they are).",

We hold the examples of protest with in our head, and those examples are always  ones we agree with and were successful.  But not every person waving their sign on the street is pure of heart and off to change the world.\n\nI think this study is too limited to really address the social aspects its trying to analyze.",
