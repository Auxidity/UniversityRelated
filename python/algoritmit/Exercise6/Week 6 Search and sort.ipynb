Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ (linear time)."

    "Suppose the algorithm makes $k$ comparisons before returning the search result. At every step, the length of the sublist is halved, so the length of the searchable list will be $n/2^k$ when the search ends. This means that there is only one item to be compared anymore, so at $k^{th}$ step, we have $n/2^k = 1$. This yields $n=2^k$, and finally $\\log(n) = k$. Thus, this algorithm ends in logarithmic time."
