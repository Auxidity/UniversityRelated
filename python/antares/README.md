# Antares

# This repository contains my thesis work.

The contents are the backbone of my thesis. However, it should be noted that whatever was achieved here is just a first prototype that serves purely as a PoC. Do not try to use this for anything serious, it is not ready for proper use but is more explorative in nature (due to time limitations, this could easily eat a lot more development time afterall).

## Everything under here is under my licence as part of my thesis. There are additional licences involved with VOSK, Reddit and Telegram and other libraries that you also have to respect that I do not own.

## Respect any licences that can be found below as is. This material has been used only for educational purposes.
