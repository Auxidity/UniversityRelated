# Object-oriented programming with python

## Course timeline

The course extends over one semester with work distributed over 14 weeks.  

| Weeks | content |
|---|---|
| 1-2 | Getting the working [environment set up](environment-setup/README.md), getting familiar with vscode, git and gitlab 
| 3-10 | For the basic OO concepts we follow the material and exercises starting from  https://programming-24.mooc.fi/part-8 The OO topic covers parts 8-10 there. The same material is available in Finnish too https://ohjelmointi-24.mooc.fi/osa-8  <br> Every mooc exercise has a prenamed folder in this repo, where you should submit your work using development cycle <br> 1. edit and debug in vscode <br> 2. commit to local repo<br>3. push to your gitlab repo
| 11-14 | Advanced OO development and applications |

## Course work methods

Human learning is most effective when the student needs to refresh the topic over regular intervals. This is why we want to distribute the workload over every week in the semester.
- **You must attend the weekly sessions**. 
- You shall **provide evidence of regular systematic work** by creating a unbroken commit history in your repository. The development cycle has high effect on course grade (max 40/100 pts).
> Why does it matter how did the work get done, isn't it enough to get the results? In all software development standards and practises it has been realised that it is not possible to guarantee SW quality by assessing only the outcome. To get high quality software you need to apply all best practises like well-defined development process, version control, code reviews, automated testing and so on. In this course we focus on defined common development environment and version control.
