The contents of this folder are from the preceeding capstone group. It has not been curated in any form, but is included if you wish to take a look at it.

As a side note, all of the contents of the raw_data folder has been removed due to size limitations to what can be pushed to a git (these limitations did not exist previously so a year ago it was possible to create large gits).
In case the raw data is of significance (which is unlikely), it can be found under the following git:	Health_Tech_RnD / Bosch_Gas_Sensor
