# Project Althael

The goal is to create a local but exportable account/password manager with some features, by me for me.
Reason for creating such a program is to alleviate credentials used for login that have been sold by the service provider to ever cross match across other services.

## Password / Account manager
Planned features consist of using automatically generated gmails +{service_name} feature and burner mails with urlsafe passwords that are stored encrypted locally.
Also allow for grouped accounts (certain services under same account details, with different pws)


# This course is related to a hobby project described above turned into credits

This contains a password manager that runs as a TUI. It could use some refinement honestly.
